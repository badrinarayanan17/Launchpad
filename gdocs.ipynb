      "• Suicidal Prevention Chatbot: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) System that utilizes LangChain, Chainlit, Groq, Pinecone. It provides immediate mental health support, making help accessible when it’s needed most. Upon detecting potential suicidal intent, the chatbot triggers an automated alert system, sending an email notification to a designated organization for immediate human intervention. It uses the Llama3-8b-8192 LLM model to deliver a more appropriate response. \n",
